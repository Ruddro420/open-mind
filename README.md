### Features
This web app is a funny app made for girls. Girls often don't understand what type of dress to wear for an event or how they will like it. This is the place I created to boost their confidence by giving them random values. This app will randomly give some values such as what you would like to read, how to dress up, and which type of bag you would like to take, they will get it by answering some questions.
